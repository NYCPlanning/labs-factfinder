showReliabilityData: ACS data are derived from a survey and are subject to sampling variability. Grayed values are not statistically reliable.
guidanceOnAcsData: Data associated with estimates of zero, top- and bottom- coded estimates, or Coefficients of Variation (CVs) of 20% or more are grayed out to signify poor statistical reliability. Comparisons and changes over time that are not statistically significant at a 90% confidence level are also grayed out.
