              <p>The Map View allows users to select geographies to create profiles. Further, users can examine geographic characteristics that may inform the selection of areas to be profiled.

              <h3 class="header-medium">Geographic Summary Level</h3>
              <p>Users have four options of geographic summary levels: Census Blocks, Census Tracts, Neighborhood Tabulation Areas (NTAs), or Public Use Microdata Areas (PUMAs). NYC Population FactFinder will provide profiles for all selections made within a specific geographic summary level.</p>
